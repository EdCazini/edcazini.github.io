<p>
Caught again, Your faithless friend<br>
Don't You ever tire of hearing what a fool I've been?<br>
Guess I should pray but what can I say?<br>
Oh, it hurts to know the hundred times I've caused You pain
</p><p>
Though 'Forgive me' sounds so empty when I never change<br>
Yet You stay and say, "I love you still"<br>
Forgiving me time and time again
</p><p>
It's Your stubborn love that never lets go of me<br>
I don't understand how You can stay<br>
Perfect love embracing the worst in me<br>
How I long for Your stubborn love
</p><p>
Funny me, just couldn't see<br>
Even long before I knew You, You were loving me<br>
Sometimes I cry, You must cry too<br>
When You see the broken promises I've made to You
</p><p>
I keep saying that I'll trust You though I seldom do<br>
Yet You stay and say, "You love me still"<br>
Knowing someday I'll be like You
</p><p>
And Your stubborn love, it never lets go of me<br>
I don't understand how You can stay<br>
Perfect love embracing the worst in me<br>
How I long for Your stubborn love
</p><p>
It's Your stubborn love that never lets go of me<br>
I don't understand how You can stay<br>
Perfect love embracing the worst in me<br>
And You never let me go, I believe I finally know<br>
I can't live without Your stubborn love
