<p>
Wise men say, only fools rush in<br>
But I can't help, falling in love with you
</p><p>
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin<br>
If I can't help, falling in love with you
</p><p>
<em><u>Refrain:</u></em><br>
Like a river flows, surely to the sea<br>
Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be
</p><p>
Take my hand, take my whole life, too<br>
For I can't help, falling in love with you<br>
For I can't help, falling in love with you
</p>
