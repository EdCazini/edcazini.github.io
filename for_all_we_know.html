Love, look at the two of us<br>
Strangers in many ways<br>
We've got a lifetime to share<br>
So much to say and as we go<br>
From day to day
</p><p>
I'll feel you close to me<br>
But time alone will tell<br>
Let's take a lifetime to say<br>
I knew you well<br>
For only time will tell us so<br>
And love may grow for all we know<br>
