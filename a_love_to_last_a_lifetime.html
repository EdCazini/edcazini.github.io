<p>
We're all just merely passing through<br>
Doing what we can do in a lifetime<br>
We have more than one adventure to take<br>
More than one dream to make in our lifetime<br>
As for me there's only one dream<br>
And that's to love you, my love<br>
With a love to last a lifetime
</p><p>
We're fools we sometimes do crazy things<br>
And our hearts would take wins like a sparrow<br>
But that's life<br>
We'll take each day as it comes<br>
Never leaving the crumbs for the morrow<br>
As for me, all of my days I will spend them all with you<br>
Loving you with love to last a lifetime
</p><p>
If we all could leave something lasting behind to be remembered by<br>
Just a song for me and that at least I would have tried<br>
I agree it's not so much what we have<br>
As how we use what we have in our lifetime<br>
</p><p>
Thirty years is worth a hundred and two<br>
It's really what we can do in our lifetime<br>
All my love I would give for as long as I may live<br>
With a love to last, a last of a lifetime
</p>
