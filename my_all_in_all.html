<p>
You are my strength when I am weak<br>
You are the treasure that I seek<br>
You are my all in all<br>
Seeking You as a precious jewel<br>
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool<br>
You are my all in all
</p></p>
<em><u>Chorus:</u></em><br>
Jesus, Lamb of God<br>
Worthy is Your name<br>
Jesus, Lamb of God<br>
Worthy is Your name
</p></p>
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame<br>
Rising again I bless Your name<br>
You are my all in all<br>
When I fall down You pick me up<br>
When I am dry You fill my cup<br>
You are my all in all
</p></p>
(Repeat Chorus)
