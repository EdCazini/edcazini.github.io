<p>
So many nights I'd sit by my window<br>
Waiting for someone to sing me his song<br>
So many dreams I kept deep inside me<br>
Alone in the dark but now you've come along.
</p><p>
And you light up my life<br>
You give me hope to carry on<br>
You light up my days<br>
And fill my nights with song.
</p><p>
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water<br>
Could it be finally I'm turnin' for home?<br>
Finally a chance to say "Hey, I love you"<br>
Never again to be all alone.
</p><p>
And you light up my life<br>
You give me hope to carry on<br>
You light up my days<br>
And fill my nights with song.
</p><p>
'Cause you, you light up my life<br>
You give me hope to carry on<br>
You light up my days<br>
And fill my nights with song.
</p><p>
It can't be wrong<br>
When it feels so right<br>
'Cause you.....you light up my life.
