You are the one who makes me happy<br>
When everything else turns to gray<br>
Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings<br>
And sends me out into the day.
</p><p>
You are the crowd that sits quiet<br>
List'ning to me<br>
With all the mad sense that I make<br>
You are one of the few things worth remembering<br>
And since it's all true<br>
How could anyone mean more to me<br>
Than you.
</p><p>
Sorry if sometimes I look past you<br>
There's no one beyond your eyes<br>
Inside my head where wheels are turning<br>
Hey, sometimes I'm not so wise.
</p><p>
You are my heart and my soul, my inspiration<br>
Just like an old love song goes<br>
You are one of the few things worth remembering<br>
And since it's all true<br>
How could anyone mean more to me<br>
Than you.
