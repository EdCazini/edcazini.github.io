<em><u>Refrain:</u></em><br>
God will make a way<br>
Where there seems to be no way<br>
He works in ways we cannot see<br>
He will make a way for me<br>
He will be my guide<br>
Hold me closely to His side<br>
With love and strength for each new day<br>
He will make a way<br>
He will make a way.
</p><p>
(Repeat Refrain)
</p><p>
<em><u>Verse:</u></em><br>
By the roadway in the wilderness<br>
He'll lead me<br>
Rivers in the desert will I see<br>
Heaven and earth will fade<br>
But His Words will still remain<br>
He will do something new today.
</p><p>
(Repeat Refrain)
</p><p>
<em><u>End:</u></em>&nbsp;With love and strength<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;For each new day<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;He will make a way<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;He will make a way.
