When I talk to you I know you listen,<br>
And when I'm scared I always know that you are there.<br>
In your presence I will feel your comfort,<br>
That's why I know that I can come to you in prayer,<br>
It's in the stillness that you touch me,<br>
And show me just how much you care.<br>
And as my heart fills with your wonder,<br>
I know that you are always there.
</p><p>
You are always there, You are always there,<br>
And your love will never cease, You fill me with your peace,<br>
You are always there (always there).<br>
You are always there, You are always there,<br>
When I come to you in prayer,<br>
I know that you are always there.
</p><p>
There are times when I have been too busy,<br>
And there are times when I don't take the time to pray.<br>
But you are always there just waiting for me,<br>
Until I come to you and put my cares away,<br>
It's in the stillness that you touch me,<br>
And show me just how much you care.<br>
And as my heart fills with your wonder,<br>
I know that you are always there.
</p><p>
You are always there, You are always there,<br>
And your love will never cease, You fill me with your peace,<br>
You are always there (always there).<br>
You are always there, You are always there,<br>
When I come to you in prayer,<br>
I know that you are always there.
</p><p>
<em><u>End:</u></em><br>
&emsp;When I come to you in prayer,<br>
&emsp;I know that you are always there.
