<em><u>Chorus:</u></em><br>
Bless the Lord, Oh my soul<br>
Oh my soul, worship His holy name<br>
Sing like never before, Oh my soul<br>
I'll worship Your holy name
</p><p>
<em><u>Verse 1:</u></em><br>
The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning<br>
It's time to sing your song again<br>
Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me<br>
Let me be singing when the evening comes<br>
(Repeat Chorus)
</p><p>
<em><u>Verse 2:</u></em><br>
You're rich in love and you're slow to anger<br>
Your name is great and your heart is kind<br>
For all your goodness, I will keep on singing<br>
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find<br>
(Repeat Chorus)
</p><p>
ADLIB
</p><p>
<em><u>Verse 3:</u></em><br>
And on that day when my strength is failing<br>
The end draws near and my time has come<br>
Still my soul will sing your praise unending<br>
Ten thousand years and then forevermore<br>
Forevermore<br>
(Repeat Chorus 2x)
