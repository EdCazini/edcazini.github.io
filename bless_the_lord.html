<p>
Bless the Lord, O my soul;<br>
And all that is within me, bless His holy name!<br>
Bless the Lord, O my soul,<br>
And forget not all His benefits:<br>
Who forgives all your iniquities,<br>
Who heals all your diseases,<br>
Who redeems your life from destruction,<br>
Who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies,<br>
Who satisfies your mouth with good things,<br>
So that your youth is renewed like the eagleâ€™s.<br>
The Lord executes righteousness<br>
And justice for all who are oppressed.
