<p>
Tomorrow mornin' if you wake up<br>
And the sun does not appear<br>
I...I will be here<br>
If in the dark we lose sight of love<br>
Hold my hand and have no fear<br>
'Cause I...I will be here.
</p><p>
<em><u>Refrain:</u></em><br>
I will be here<br>
When you feel like bein' quiet<br>
When you need to speak your mind<br>
I will listen.
</p><p>
And I will be here<br>
When the laughter turns to cryin'<br>
Through the winnin' and losin' and tryin'<br>
We'll be together<br>
'Cause I will be here.
</p><p>
Tomorrow mornin' if you wake up<br>
And the future is unclear<br>
I...I'll be here<br>
Just as sure as seasons are made for change<br>
Our lifetimes are made for years<br>
So I...I will be here.
</p><p>
<em><u>Refrain:</u></em><br>
I will be here<br>
You can cry on my shoulder<br>
When the mirror tells us we're older<br>
I will hold you.
</p><p>
And I will be here<br>
To watch you grow in beauty<br>
And tell you all the things you are to me<br>
I will be here.
</p><p>
<em><u>Bridge:</u></em><br>
I will be true to the promise I have made<br>
To you and to the one who gave you to me.
</p><p>
Tomorrow mornin' if you wake up<br>
And the future is unclear<br>
I...I'll be here<br>
Just as sure as seasons are made for change<br>
Our lifetimes are made for years<br>
So I...I will be here.
