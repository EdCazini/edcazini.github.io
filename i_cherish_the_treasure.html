<em><u>Men:</u></em><br>
I cherish the treasure<br>
The treasure of you<br>
Lifelong companion<br>
I give myself to you<br>
God has enabled me<br>
To walk with you faithfully<br>
And cherish the treasure<br>
The treasure of you.
</p><p>
<em><u>Women:</u></em><br>
As I obey the Spirit's voice<br>
And seek to do His will<br>
I then can see the wisdom of His plan<br>
For as He works His will in me<br>
I then can love you selflessly<br>
And by His grace,<br>
Can pledge my love to you.
</p><p>
<em><u>All:</u></em><br>
I cherish the treasure<br>
The treasure of you<br>
Lifelong companion<br>
I give myself to you<br>
God has enabled me<br>
To walk with you faithfully<br>
And cherish the treasure<br>
The treasure of you.
</p><p>
<em><u>Men:</u></em><br>
This sacred vow I make to you<br>
Does not contain an "if"<br>
Though I'm aware that trials lie ahead<br>
</p><p>
<em><u>Women:</u></em><br>
I will love you and pray with you<br>
And through it all, I will stay with you<br>
Our home will be a refuge of<br>
Unconditional love.
</p><p>
<em><u>All:</u></em><br>
I cherish the treasure<br>
The treasure of you<br>
Lifelong companion<br>
I give myself to you<br>
God has enabled me<br>
To walk with you faithfully<br>
And cherish the treasure<br>
The treasure of you.
</p><p>
<em><u>End:</u></em><br>
&emsp;Cherish the treasure<br>
&emsp;The treasure of you.
