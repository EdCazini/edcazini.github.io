<p>
I cherish the treasure<br>
The treasure of you<br>
Lifelong companion<br>
I give myself to you<br>
God has enabled me<br>
To walk with you faithfully<br>
And cherish the treasure<br>
The treasure of you

As I obey the Spirit's voice<br>
And seek to do His will<br>
I then can see the wisdom of His plan<br>
For as He works His will in me<br>
I then can love you selflessly<br>
And by His grace, can pledge my love to you

Chorus
This sacred vow I make to you
Does not contain an "if"
Though I'm aware that trials lie ahead
I will love you and pray with you
And through it all, I will stay with you
Our home will be a refuge of
Unconditional love
Chorus
Cherish the treasure
The treasure of you
</p><p>
Ang sumpa ko sa iyo'y asahan<br>
Ikaw lamang ang aking iibigin<br>
Magpakailanman
