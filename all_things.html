All things (echo)<br>
Work together (echo)<br>
For the good of those(echo)<br>
Who love You
</p><p>
When things are beyond my control<br>
To You Lord I lift up my soul<br>
And when things are hard to understand<br>
Lord I trust in Your perfect plan
</p><p>
Some things hazy will someday be clear<br>
Some things hidden will one day appear<br>
And some things so wrong will be made right<br>
As we walk in Your perfect light
</p><p>
End:<br>
We are those (echo)<br>
Who love You<br>
We are those (echo)<br>
Who love You.
