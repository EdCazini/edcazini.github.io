<em><u>Refrain:</u></em><br>
Till the end of my days O Lord,<br>
I will bless Your name,<br>
Sing Your praise, give You thanks,<br>
All my days.
</p><p>
You have made me little less than a god,<br>
And have lavished my heart with Your love,<br>
With dignity and honor You've clothed me,<br>
Given me rule over all.
</p><p>
Till the end of my days O Lord,<br>
I will bless Your name,<br>
Sing Your praise, give You thanks,<br>
All my days.
</p><p>
You have blessed me with good things and plenty,<br>
And surrounded my table with friends.<br>
Their love and their laughter enrich me;<br>
Together we sing Your praise.
</p><p>
Till the end of my days O Lord,<br>
I will bless Your name,<br>
Sing Your praise, give You thanks,<br>
All my days.
</p><p>
Your sun and Your moon give me light,<br>
And Your stars show the way through the night,<br>
Your rivers and streams have refreshed me.<br>
I will sing Your praise.
</p><p>
Till the end of my days O Lord,<br>
I will bless Your name,<br>
Sing Your praise, give You thanks,<br>
All my days.
