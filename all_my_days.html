<p>
May this life that I live bring you praises<br>
Blessing You and Your wonderful ways<br>
In the work of my hands and the words that I say<br>
I will worship You Lord all my days
</p><p>
I will sing to Your name when I wake<br>
Giving thanks for each breath that I take<br>
From the first light I see to the last prayer I pray<br>
I will worship You Lord all my days
</p><p>
All my days, (all my days)<br>
All my days, (all my days)<br>
I will worship You Lord all my days<br>
All my days, (all my days)<br>
All my days,<br>
I will worship You Lord all my days
</p><p>
May this life that I life make you glad<br>
Help me praise you with all that I have<br>
May the thoughts of my heart bring a smile to Your face<br>
I will worship You Lord all my days
</p><p>
Everyday is a gift from Your hand<br>
You're the author of all that I am<br>
May my story be told in this heart-spoken phrase<br>
I will worship You Lord all my days<br>
(Repeat )
</p><p>
All my days, (all my days)<br>
All my days, (all my days)<br>
I will worship You Lord all my days<br>
For as long as I live by Your power and grace<br>
I will worship You Lord, worship You Lord<br>
I will worship You Lord, worship You Lord<br>
I will worship You Lord, all my days
