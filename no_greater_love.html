You love me when<br>
I was so unlovely<br>
You sought me when i was so lost<br>
You showed me<br>
How much you really love me<br>
When you bought me<br>
At the highest cost
</p><p>
There's no greater love than this<br>
There's no greater love than this<br>
That a man would  give his love for a friend<br>
There's no higher sacrifice<br>
Than a man would give his life<br>
You have paid<br>
A precious price for me
</p><p>
When chose me<br>
When i was so unworthy<br>
You cleansed me<br>
With your own blood<br>
You clothed me<br>
With righteousness and mercy<br>
And you crowned me<br>
With you steadfast love
</p><p>
There's no greater love than this<br>
There's no greater love than this<br>
That a man would give his life for a friend<br>
There's no higher sacrifice<br>
That a man would give his love for a friend<br>
There's no higher sacrifice<br>
That a man would give his life<br>
You have a paid<br>
A precious price for me
</p><p>
You have a paid <br>
A precious price for me
