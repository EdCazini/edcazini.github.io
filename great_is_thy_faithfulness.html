<p>
Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father;<br>
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;<br>
Thou changeth not, Thy compassions, they fail not;<br>
As Thou hath been Thou forever wilt be.
</p><p>
<em><u>Refrain:</u></em><br>
Great is Thy faithfulness!<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness!<br>
Morning by morning new mercies I see;<br>
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided;<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!
</p><p>
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth<br>
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;<br>
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,<br>
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand besides<br>
</p><p>
<em><u>Refrain:</u></em><br>
Great is Thy faithfulness!<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness!<br>
Morning by morning new mercies I see;<br>
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided;<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!
</p><p>
<em><u>Refrain:</u></em><br>
Great is Thy faithfulness!<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness!<br>
Morning by morning new mercies I <u>see</u>;<br>
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided;<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness, Great is Thy faithfulness<br>
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!
