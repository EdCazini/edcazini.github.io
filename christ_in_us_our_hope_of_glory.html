<em><u>Verse 1: (gents)</u></em><br>
We felt your word burning within us<br>
Your word unlocked the hardness of our hearts<br>
And opened our eyes that we may see you<br>
Hidden in the broken bread
</p><p>
<em><u>Verse 2: (ladies)</u></em><br>
You brought a ray of light<br>
And you rekindled our hope<br>
And led our hearts to yearn for your love<br>
For in you is our hope of glory
</p><p>
<em><u>Chorus:</u></em><br>
Lord you laid down your life as bread and wine we see<br>
Gave strength to our hearts and made us shine with glee<br>
When we eat the bread and drink the cup of wine<br>
We believe that Christ in us, is our hope of glory
</p><p>
<em><u>Bridge:</u></em><br>
Through your own flesh, now made living<br>
And by the Spirit made life-giving<br>
You offer life to us<br>
And as your sweat became like drops of blood<br>
Falling down upon the ground<br>
You shed your blood for us ... Amen
</p><p>
<em><u>Chorus:</u></em><br>
Lord you laid down your life as bread and wine we see<br>
Gave strength to our hearts and made us shine with glee<br>
When we eat the bread and drink the cup of wine<br>
We believe that Christ in us, is our hope of glory<br>
We believe that Christ in us, is our hope of glory
