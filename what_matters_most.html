<p>
It's not how long we held each other's hand<br>
What matters is how well we loved each other<br>
It's not how far we traveled on our way<br>
But what we found to say<br>
It's not the spring you see,<br>
But all the shades of green.
</p><p>
It's not how long I held you in my arms<br>
What matters is how sweet the years together<br>
It's not how many summer times we had to give to fall<br>
An early morning smile we tearfully recall<br>
What matters most is that we loved at all.<br>
(Repeat)
</p><p>
<em>End:</em>&nbsp;What matters most is that we loved at all.
